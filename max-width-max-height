To adjust an image inside its container no matter the width or the size of it,
use max-width and max-height:
      
.product_cover img      {display:inline-block ;margin: auto; 

max-height: 500px; 
max-width: 500px;

}

If the image is wider than 500px it will be readjusted to a width of 500px
If the image is higher than 500px it will be readjusted to a height of 500px
